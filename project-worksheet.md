# Project Overview

## Project Links

- [add your github repo link](https://github.com/s4178jm/project-02/blob/master/project-worksheet.md)
- [add your deployment link](https://5e8b16b1a579bb02f4c42030--festive-clarke-da23bb.netlify.com/)

## Project Description

Newsapp allows readers to compare how top news is reported across countries. The user is invited to type a search term, which will make three separate API calls to NewsAPI and return three windows offering the top results in the US, UK and the rest of the world.
## API

Use this section to include info about the API you have chosen and a code snippet of the data that it returns and is required for your project. 

News api:https://newsapi.org/



## Wireframes

Upload images of wireframe to cloudinary and add the link here with a description of the specific wireframe. Also, define the the React components and the architectural design of your app.

- [add link to your react architecture]()


### MVP/PostMVP - 5min

The functionality will then be divided into two separate lists: MPV and PostMVP.  Carefully decided what is placed into your MVP as the client will expect this functionality to be implemented upon project completion.  

#### MVP 
-- Allow user to input a search term
-- Render the API data in three separate containers 
-- For the non-English results, there is an automatic call to a translation API.


#### PostMVP EXAMPLE

-- Each news item is styled with a small logo 
-- The three news containers are styled so that their background color automatically fades when they are filled with news items.


## Components
##### Writing out your components and its descriptions isn't a required part of the proposal but can be helpful.

Based on the initial logic defined in the previous sections try and breakdown the logic further into stateless/stateful components. 

| Component | Description | 
| --- | :---: |  
| App | This will make the initial data pull and include React Router | 
| Header | This will render the header include the nav | 
| Form | This will ask the user location |
| Current Weather | This will render weather component |
| 5 days Forecast | This will render 5 days Forecast component |
| UV info | This will render UV info |


Time frames are also key in the development cycle.  You have limited time to code all phases of the game.  Your estimates can then be used to evalute game possibilities based on time needed and the actual time you have before game must be submitted. It's always best to pad the time by a few hours so that you account for the unknown so add and additional hour or two to each component to play it safe. Also, put a gif at the top of your Readme before you pitch, and you'll get a panda prize.

| Component | Priority | Estimated Time | Time Invetsted | Actual Time |
| --- | :---: |  :---: | :---: | :---: |
|Input handling	High|	4hrs|	N/A|	N/A|
|Comparing search result vs source list|	High|	2hrs|	N/A|	N/A|
|Configuring API	High|	4hrs|	N/A|	N/A|
|API response tweaking|	High|	4hrs|	N/A|	N/A|
|Write Out Components|	High|	4hrs|	N/A|	N/A|
|UX and ReadME tweaks|	Medium|	2hrs|	N/A|	N/A|
|Total|		20hrs|	N/A|	N/A|

## Additional Libraries
 Use this section to list all supporting libraries and thier role in the project such as Axios, ReactStrap, D3, etc. 

## Code Snippet

Use this section to include a brief code snippet of functionality that you are proud of an a brief description.  Code snippet should not be greater than 10 lines of code. 

```
function reverse(string) {
	// here is the code to reverse a string of text
}
```
